# The hackathon

See the initial checkins for examples of the data. We will need to add more to the data, but not more than 15/20 lines of data for each file. We can discuss the data further. Idea is not to create very detailed data, just enough to make things interesting.

## Proceeding

- Form 2 or more teams.
- Each team has members from Noodle and SMS.
- Give each team their own directory in which to checkin code.
- No proprietary code. This will be a private repo but at this stage all code is assumed to be public.


## Desired outcome

- Team should come up with some approximation to the actual application we are trying to build. I.e. The output should be a heat schedule with a suggested scrap mix + a Value-in-use dollar amount. We can specify a Value-in-use function or leave it to the teams.
- Teams try to create modules that will actually exist in the real product (at least in terms of calls between them / APIs).
- Teams can create simple text output to stdout. They can create a little webapp to give output as a web page. They can really do whatever they want.
- The code must run and produce the output based on the data. We will change the data and see what happens to the output.
- All code should be placed in public repository, no hidden or proprietary code

## What can we create?

You should do something with the data!

- that can be a machine learning model that predicts when the next scrap order arrives
- a dashboard that visualises the sequences
- a tool that detects NaNs in the data
- a tool that will allow you to replace NaNs in the data
- a dashboard that visualizes the size of the pile on the scrapyard
... 

Teams will have 48 hours total from start to finish. We can let Dirk judge the winning team - they get lunch from the other team.
